Programming Resources for Engineering Students/Alumni
=====================================================

Programming is intimidating, but it does not have to be. If you know where to start and what concepts to learn first, you can be a programmer on an enjoyable path. This guide is open to contributions. If you have any resource recommendations, send a pull request.



A. FUNDAMENTALS
===============

It's always good to start with the fundamentals.

### 1. CS50x

The best introduction course to computer science offered by Harvard. [Online lectures are available](https://cs50.harvard.edu/).

### 2. Tech Dev Guide

Start your CS journey with [Google's Tech Dev Guide](https://techdevguide.withgoogle.com/) curated by Google engineers and university faculty.

### 3. Github Basics

Having a version control system makes your life easier. [Github's offical](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) tutorial is a good place to start.

### 4. A Civil Engineer & Developer Story

You are not alone. [Watch the story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGOmyRZoUSs) of one of our friends' presentations. (Turkish)

### 5. Which path?

If you are not sure which path to follow, Web, ML, etc. You may take [this survey](https://bit.ly/hangipatika) and see results. (Turkish)



B. SCIENTIFIC COMPUTING
=======================

If you need to make mathematical computations, you can start with

### 1. MATLAB

The most used language in universities. But it's not free, hope your university has a license. [This Coursera course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/matlab) is not bad.

### 2. Python

Python is the best language to start with for programming since it has an easy syntax. It's free and scalable. There is an [Introduction to Programming](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-7091-1343-1) book. Arindam Dawn's [30 Days of Python](https://dev.to/arindamdawn/series/7425) Series helps you to learn Python in one month.


C. WEB
======

Web programming is where most programmers end up with

### 1. HTML & CSS

Learning this couple is like learning the alphabets of web programming. Codeacademy's interactive [HTML](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html) & [CSS](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-css) courses are fun for beginners.

### 2. Javascript

If you learn JS and love it, you become unstoppable. Instead of millions of free JS courses, start with a cheap but [qualifed Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/). Once you know the basics of JS, [Just Javascript](https://justjavascript.com/) helps you build the mental model of how JavaScript works. This guide perfectly summarizes how to write [Clean Code](https://github.com/ryanmcdermott/clean-code-javascript)

### 3. NodeJS & Express

I don't have a stand-alone NodeJS course because most of them are included in JS courses. Search on Google to be a full-stack JS developer.

### 4. ReactJS

ReactJS is one of the most trending frameworks. The official site has very good documentation and tutorials. [Best learning resource](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) for reading type people.

### 5. Bootstrap

The best way to learn a CSS framework is to use it in your own projects. Find the best element for your requirements via [its website.](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/)

### 6. ThreeJS

Creating 3D views in a browser makes you amazing. If you need such a visualization, it has a minimalist [docs](https://threejs.org/docs/).



D. MACHINE LEARNING
===================

Whether you want to be a machine learning engineer or not, you should have some fundamental knowledge.

### 1. AI for Everyone

Andrew NG is the introduction teacher for ML. [This course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/ai-for-everyone) is really for everyone.

### 2. Introduction to ML

A brief introduction to the ML course organized by the Global AI Hub community. Free access to [videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5cQhn5g7gJXxugJGpySX2diWg9sRaogN) and [lecture slides](https://drive.google.com/file/d/109ruTjsp-KiRHl7W2WtLcJKECSe9wVNZ/view) are available. (Turkish)

### 3. Mathematics for ML

You can learn about the prerequisite mathematics for applications in data science and machine learning offered by Imperial College London. [Mathematics for Machine Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/mathematics-machine-learning).

### 4. Machine Learning

The most beneficial course on Coursera is [Machine Learning Course.](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) Most probably better than your university ML lectures.

### 5. Deep Learning

Andrew Ng's "Deep Learning: Zero to Hero" course series is highly suggested under the [Deep Learning Specialization Program](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning).

### 6. Deep Learning for Computer Vision

[CS231n](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/) is one of the fundamental courses of computer vision at Stanford University. I suggest the [Winter 2016 semester lectures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfnWJUyUJYU&list=PLkt2uSq6rBVctENoVBg1TpCC7OQi31AlC) in which NN parts were given by [Andrej Karpathy](https://karpathy.ai/). Lecture notes and assignments are available [here](https://github.com/maxim5/cs231n-2016-winter).
