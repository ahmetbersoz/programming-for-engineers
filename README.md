Programming Resources for Engineering Students/Alumni
=====================================================

Programming is intimidating but it does not to be. If you know where to start and what concepts to learn first, you can be programmer in an enjoyful path. This guide is open to contribution. If you have any resource recommandation send a pull request via [github](https://github.com/ahmetbersoz/programming-for-engineers).

A. FUNDAMENTALS
===============

It's always good to start with fundamentals.

### 1. CS50x

Best introduction course to computer science offered by Harvard. [Online lectures are available](https://cs50.harvard.edu/).

### 2. Tech Dev Guide

Start your CS journey with [Google's Tech Dev Guide](https://techdevguide.withgoogle.com/) curated by Google engineers and university faculty.

### 3. Github Basics

Having a version control system makes your life easier. [Github's offical](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) tutorial is good to start.

### 4. A Civil Engineer & Developer Story

You are not alone. [Watch the story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGOmyRZoUSs) of one of our friends presentation. (Turkish)

### 5. Which path?

If you are not sure which path should you follow? Web, ML or etc. You may take [this survey](https://bit.ly/hangipatika) and see results. (Turkish)

B. SCIENTIFIC COMPUTING
=======================

If you need make mathematical computations. You can start with.

### 1. MATLAB

The most used language in universities. But it's not free, hope your university have a license. [This Coursera course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/matlab) is not bad.

### 2. Python

Python is best to start for programming since it has easy syntax. It's free and scalable. There is an [Introduction to Programming](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-7091-1343-1) book.

C. WEB
======

Web programming is where most programmers are end up with.

### 1. HTML & CSS

Learning this couple is like alphabets of the web programming. Codeacademy's interactive [HTML](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html) & [CSS](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-css) courses are fun for beginners.

### 2. Javascript

If you learn JS and love it, you become unstoppable. Instead of millions of free JS courses, start with an cheap but [qualifed Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/). Once you know the basics of JS, [Just Javascript](https://justjavascript.com/) helps you to build the mental model of how JavaScript works.

### 3. NodeJS & Express

I don't have a stand alone NodeJS course, because most of them are included in JS courses. Search on google to be a full stack JS developer.

### 4. ReactJS

ReactJS is one of the most trending framework. Offical site has very good documentation and tutorials. [Best learning resource](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) for reading type people.

### 5. Bootstrap

The best way of learning a CSS framework is use it your own project. Find the best element for your requirements via [its website.](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/)

### 6. ThreeJS

Creating 3D views in a browser makes you amazing. If you need such a visualization, it has a minimalist [docs](https://threejs.org/docs/).

E. MACHINE LEARNING
===================

Whether you want to be a machine learning engineer or not, you should have a fundalmental knowledge.

### 1. AI For Everyone

Andrew NG is like introduction teacher of ML. [This course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/ai-for-everyone) is really for everyone.

### 2. Introduction to ML

A brief introduction to ML course organized by Global AI Hub community. Free access to [videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5cQhn5g7gJXxugJGpySX2diWg9sRaogN) and [lecture slides](https://drive.google.com/file/d/109ruTjsp-KiRHl7W2WtLcJKECSe9wVNZ/view) are available. (Turkish)

### 3. Mathematics for ML

You can learn about the prerequisite mathematics for applications in data science and machine learning offered by Imperial College London. [Mathematics for Machine Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/mathematics-machine-learning).

### 4. Machine Learning

The most beneficial courses of Coursera is [Machine Learning Course.](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) Most probably better than your university ML lectures.

### 5. Deep Learning

Andrew Ng's deep learning zero to hero course series are highly suggested under the [Deep Learning Specialization Program](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning).


### 6. Deep Learning for Computer Vision

[CS231n](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/) is one of fundamental courses of computer vision at Stanford University. I suggest [Winter 2016 semester lectures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfnWJUyUJYU&list=PLkt2uSq6rBVctENoVBg1TpCC7OQi31AlC) in which NN parts were given by [Andrej Karpathy](https://karpathy.ai/). Lecture notes and assignments are available [here](https://github.com/maxim5/cs231n-2016-winter).
